An AI - is an intelligent agent and interacts with its environment

sensors

actuators

control policy

Perception action cycle

## Usage 

AI has been used in finance, robotics, games, ...

### Finance

Training agent

Environment - Bond market, stock market, rates, news

Decisions - Buy or sell, trades

### Robotics

Cameras

Motors

Web crawlers first web robots

### Games

Game agent 

Example chess

input/environment - your moves
its moves

### Medicine

Diagnostic agent

Vital signals

Diagnostics

Medicine

### Web

Google search

Crawler agent -> WWW -> Db -> Query -> Response 

## Terminology

Environment - Fully vs Partially Observable

Ex poker, cards on the table, or cards as they are revealed

Environment has internal state

Agent may see partial state with past information

Agents in partial environments may need internal memory to keep track of past environment state

Deterministic vs stochastic - some randomness

Discrete vs continuous - may be infinite 

Benign - web search vs adversarial - games, chess



Quiz - 

Checkers - fully observable, deterministics, adversarial
Poker - partial o, stochastic, descrete, adversarial

Robotic car - partial, stochastic, continuous


AI as uncertainty mgt
AI When you don't know what to do

Reasons for uncertainty

Sensor limits
Laziness
Stochastic environment
ignorance
adversaries
